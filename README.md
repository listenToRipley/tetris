# RULES from Mintbean
Turn-based (i.e. no real-time puzzle games. They must be turn-based.)
Built in JavaScript web tech. No Unity or Unreal. PhaserJS and similar frameworks are OK.
There is some kind of timer.
There is a win condition. For example, you need to sort all the numbers.
The win condition is clear. For example, a popup says "Sort the numbers!"
There is a lose condition. For example, you have max 200 moves.
The lose condition is intuitive. For example, if you run out of moves or time, you lose.
When you lose, you can press a button to easily restart.

  ~ Stretch Goals 
    Add more puzzle games to your app.
    Implement multiplayer.
    Implement chat.
    Build a scoreboard.
    Add a social "share" button for the win and lose screens.
